libPD Helper Class
==================

This is a helper class for libpd. I found myself recreating this for projects so I wanted to make it easier for myself and thought I'd attempt sharing it with the world!

To use this copy the files into your project and import the classes. There are definitely some things to take into account when setting up your project but that's beyond the scope of this...

Once it's in there follow the directions to use <a href="http://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods<a/> for adding and managing the libpd library.

I found <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/64546/introduction-to-cocoapods-2">this tutorial<a/> very helpful in learning about it as well as setting it up.

This is a work in progress and sometimes requires some tweaking so I offer no warranty as to the reusability of this at the moment. Good luck!
