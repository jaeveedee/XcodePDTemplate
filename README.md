XcodePDTemplate
===============

This is a template Xcode project for libPD. I found myself recreating this for projects so I wanted to make it easier for myself.

To use this on your Mac, put it in a folder that is just inside your home folder. On my computer I've got it at ~/Developer. Once it's in there also go and clone pd-for-ios repo into the same ~/Developer folder.'
