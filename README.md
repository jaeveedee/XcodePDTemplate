XcodePDTemplate
===============

This is a template Xcode project for libPD. I found myself recreating this for projects so I wanted to make it easier for myself.

To use this on your Mac, put it in a folder that is just inside your home folder. On my computer I've got it at ~/Developer. 

Once it's in there follow the directions to use <a href="http://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods<a/> for adding and managing the libPd library.

I found <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/64546/introduction-to-cocoapods-2">this tutorial<a/> very helpful in learning about it as well as setting it up.

- This is a work in progress and sometimes requires some tweaking so I offer no warranty as to the reusability of this at the moment. Good luck!

- Included is a dummy PD patch that shows how some of the functions can be used in your projects. Feel free to use main.pd as a starting point.
